# sample-dataset
In this directory, we provide a few sample assemblies (which is a small subset from the full "IDETC-Hackathon-2022" dataset).

Each folder represents an assembly (the folder name is the assembly's unique hash ID).

Inside each folder there are the following content:
- "assembly.json": The JSON file that contains all non-visual information of the assembly.
- "assembly.jpg":The thumbnail image of the assembly.
- "[body-id].jpg": The thumbnail image of the body of the assembly. Note that each body has a unique hash ID, just like the assemblies.
